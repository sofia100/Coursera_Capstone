## Safe and Dry Teenage places

### Introduction :
This project points out the places in Bucharest that are alcoholic or not for teenagers less than 18 years old.

There are many parents who want their children to be safe and practice the rules and regulations of the country. they should not be drinking before the legal age of the country. In this project I have made an analysis about various places that are suitable for the youth as well as the drinking sites.


### Data :
Data was available at wikipedia for Bucharest

Links are:

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Districts_of_Bucharest"

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectors_of_Bucharest"

The data was scrapped from the site using BeautifulSoup

### Methodology :
Various data from wikipedia were used to analyze the places around Bucharest and
counted number of safe places and drinking places. analysis is the data was done by 
seeing the ratings and all. Then Maps were used but got errors. On the map the points depict
the places or neighbourhoods segregated or clustered. Even a dendogram was drawn to cluster similar places as below :
